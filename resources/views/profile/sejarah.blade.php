              <p class="text">
                Wayang Riders was founded on February 12, 1999, located in one of the areas in
                West Java, namely the city of Cimahi whose founder is Irfan Santika, Gugum Gumilar who
                now serves as General Chairperson of the Wayang Riders and class of 1999.
                Wayang Riders started around 2002-2010, in early February 1999 Wayang Riders was continued with
                Generation Yudi Ardhana.
                One of the activities they often do is travel, and often hold events as a hobby
                some members who like to hang out, started to want to raise the name of their hangout.
                It was with this activity that the name Wayang Rider became known in Cimahi City and began to thrive from year to year. If you compare it, it turns out that the Wayang Riders are like a "VIRUS" which spreads quickly, in almost several areas of Cimahi City and several areas there are children of the Wayang Riders.
                The Wayang Riders are famous for their motorbike children who almost every week hold gatherings together, either in their respective areas or get-togethers that are usually held at the place where the name Wayang Riders first appeared.
                The Wayang Riders started to get excited and agreed to wear the “Orange – White” colored flag which has its own philosophy. The Orange color reflects kinship that cannot be measured by anything, while the White color itself means coloring, in other words, the bonds of kinship are formed even tighter.
                due to the different characteristics of the members but having the same goal of becoming the Wayang Riders Big Family.
                Around 2003 there was friction between the elite Wayang Riders, this resulted in a split, from this split several names emerged and the Wayang Riders themselves split into 2 groups, some continued to use the "Orange-White" flag and some wore the "Orange" flag. . -White flag. “Red – White – Black”.
